I created a small portfolio site using Bootstrap CSS Framework, it
includes a Nav Bar, along with a contact page, and a portfoilo page set
up as cards for future use. Currently there is only the one project to
display. 
* `index.html` , `portfolio.html`, and `contact.html` were all created
* nav bar installed and set up with all links working
* background image added
* sticky footer added
* bootstrap responsive layout ultilized
